# Colouring Cities Research Programme
The Colouring Cities Research Programme (CCRP) develops open code for open, reproducible platforms that collect, verify and visualise data on national building stocks. 
You can learn more about the CCPR on our main website: https://colouringcities.org/.

## Organisation Structure
The key repositories are:
- [colouring-core](https://github.com/colouring-cities/colouring-core) is the home of the new Colouring Cities Core Platform. All new Colouring Cities projects should be forked from this repo. This is the former 'Colouring London' prototype repository.  
  
- [colouring-britain](https://github.com/colouring-cities/colouring-britain) is the Colouring Britain project, which is forked from the Core Platform. This should be considered the template for all other Colouring Cities platforms.

For more information, feel free to browse the various repositories in the organisation.  
To get involved, please contact [Polly Hudson](https://github.com/orgs/colouring-cities/people/polly64): phudson@turing.ac.uk.
